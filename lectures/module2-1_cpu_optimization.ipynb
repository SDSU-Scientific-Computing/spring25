    "## 1. Introduction to CPU Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module we talk about optimizing matrix-matrix multiply on the CPU. Some of the material here is largely based on the [LAFF-On Programming for High Performance](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~flame/laff/pfhp/LAFF-On-PfHP.html) of Robert van de Geijn,\n",
    "Margaret Myers, Devangi Parikh, which has a pairing online MOOC: [LAFF-On Programming for High Performance (LAFF-On-PfHP)](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/flame/laff/pfhp/LAFF-On-PfHP.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "I encourage you to watch the videos before class. When watching the videos, really you should be watching for the _big picture_ and we will revisit most of the material in lecture as well, mainly you will have a better learning experience if the in class lectures are the first time you've seen some of the material.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MOOC is done using C (not Julia), so some of the syntax and language discussion is not relevant, but the overall ideas apply. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two big differences between the material presented in C Vs Julia:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Julia starts it's indexing with `1` whereas C uses `0`, so the first element of an array `A` in Julia is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "A[1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "whereas in C is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "A[0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second difference is that in C, matrices are not\n",
    "really first-class objects so they must be indexed as flat vectors. In Julia, even though behind the scenes everything is a flat vector, we can index into matrices directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some additional Julia related material was gleaned from Sacha Verweij's repository [GemmDemo.jl](https://github.com/Sacha0/GemmDemo.jl) and from a former colleague, Maciej Waruszewski's repository [MyJuliaGEMM](https://github.com/mwarusz/MyJuliaGEMM).\n",
