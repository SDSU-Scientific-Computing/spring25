    "    - FLOPs = Floating Pointer Operations (careful on the small \"s\" vs big \"S\") (see \n",

    "    - How to estimate: for matrix-matrix multiply we have 2 FLOP per inner loop,\n",
    "      and a triply nested loop thus total $\\text{FLOPs} = 2nmk$. The FLOPS are\n",
    "      then $\\text{FLOPS} = 2nmk / \\text{time}$. Note that usually we use\n",
    "      GigaFLOPS or GFLOPS: $\\text{GFLOPS} = 2nmk / \\text{time} / 10^9$.\n",
    "    - Calculate for one core of your machine:\n",
    "      $$\n",

    "\n",
    "- Fathoming the chief performance characteristics of a processor or system is one of the purposes of _low-level benchmarking_.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A low-level benchmark is a program that tries to test some specific feature of the architecture like, e.g., peak performance or memory bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "- One of the prominent examples is the _vector triad_, introduced by Sch√∂nauer (self-edition, 2000). It comprises a nested loop, the inner level executing a multiply add operation on the elements of three vectors and storing the result in a fourth. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example in Fortran:\n",
    "\n",
    "See the following implementation as a Fortran code snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Fortran\n",
    "double precision, dimension(N) :: A,B,C,D\n",
    "double precision :: S,E,MFLOPS\n",
    "\n",
    "do i=1,N                                !initialize arrays\n",

    "call get_walltime(S)                    ! get time stamp\n",
    "\n",
    "do j=1,R\n",
    "    do i=1,N\n",
    "        A(i) = B(i) + C(i) * D(i)       ! 3 loads, 1 store\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The purpose of this benchmark is to measure the performance of data transfers between memory and arithmetic units of a processor.\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the inner level, three _load streams_ for arrays `B`, `C` and `D` and one _store stream_ for `A` are active. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Depending on `N`, this loop might execute in a very small time, which would be hard to measure. The outer loop thus repeats the triad `R` times so that execution time becomes large enough to be accurately measurable. In practice one would choose `R` according to `N` so that the overall execution time stays roughly constant for different `N`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The aim of the masked-out call to the `dummy()` subroutine is to prevent the compiler from doing an obvious optimization: Without the call, the compiler might discover that the inner loop does not depend at all on the outer loop index `j` and drop the outer loop right away.\n",
    "- The possible call to `dummy()` fools the compiler into believing that the arrays may change between outer loop iterations. This effectively prevents the optimization described, and the additional cost is negligible because the condition is always false (which the compiler does not know in advance).\n",
    "- Please note that the most sensible time measure in benchmarking is _wallclock time_, also called _elapsed time_. Any other \"time\" that the system may provide, first and foremost the much stressed CPU time, is prone to misinterpretation because there\n",
    "might be contributions from I/O, context switches, other processes, etc., which CPU time cannot encompass (this is especially true for parallel programs).\n",
