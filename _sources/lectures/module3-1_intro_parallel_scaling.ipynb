    "### 2.1 Scalability metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to be able to define scalability we first have to identify the basic measurements on which derived performance metrics are built. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a simple model, the overall problem size (\"amount of work\") shall be $s + p = 1$, where $s$ is the **serial** (or sequential, nonparallelizable) part and $p$ is the perfectly parallelizable fraction. \n",
    "\n",
    "There can be many reasons for a nonvanishing serial part:\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Algorithmic limitations_. Operations that cannot be done in parallel because of, e.g., mutual dependencies, can only be performed one after another, or even in a certain order.\n",
    "- _Bottlenecks_. Shared resources are common in computer systems: Execution units in the core, shared paths to memory in multicore chips, I/O devices. Access to a shared resource serializes execution. Even if the algorithm itself could be performed completely in parallel, concurrency may be limited by bottlenecks.\n",
    "- _Startup overhead_. Starting a parallel program, regardless of the technical details, takes time. Of course, system designs try to minimize startup time, especially in massively parallel systems, but there is always a nonvanishing serial part. If a parallel application's overall runtime is too short, startup will have a strong impact. (This is also why usually the first elapsed time of the execution of a benchmark program is discarded when measuring performance).\n",
    "- _Communication_. Fully concurrent  communication between different parts of a parallel system cannot be taken for granted. If solving a problem in parallel requires communication, some serialization is usually unavoidable. Some communication processes limit scalability as they cannot be overlaped with each other or with calculation.\n",
    "    * Communication can be accounted for in scalability metrics in a more elaborate way than just adding a constant to the serial fraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume a fixed problem (of a _fixed size_), which is to be solved by $N$ workers. We normalize the single-worker (serial) runtime\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called **strong scaling** because the amount of work stays constant no matter how many workers are used. Here the goal of parallelization is minimization of time to solution for a given problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "If time to solution is not the primary objective because larger problem sizes (for which available memory is the limiting factor) are of interest, it is appropriate to scale the problem size with some power of $N$ so that the total amount of work is $s + pN^{\\alpha}$ , where $\\alpha$ is a positive but otherwise free parameter. Here we use the implicit assumption that the serial fraction $s$ is a constant. \n",
